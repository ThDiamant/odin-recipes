# odin-recipes

This is a very basic and introductory project, in which I created a simple cooking recipes webpage using basic HTML.

The goal of the project was to get some of the fundamentals of HTML down. More specifically, this project covere the following HTML concepts:

1. Basic HTML boilerplate.
2. Adding images to the webpage.
3. Adding different headers, paragraphs and (orderd and unordered) lists.

It is also used an introduction to CSS, having added some very simple styles to the different pages.

Everything contained in the website is taken from [this website](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes-we-cant-wait-to-make-january-2025-8763309). The project was completed in the context of the [Odin project foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).
